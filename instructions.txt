Specification
At this stage, the user can define the boundary for the stone and isolate
it from the background. In Python, write a code that enables the user to set
the boundary of the stone and separate it from the background.
From the previous step, we have the “Start Processing” button that
currently lacks functionality. When we click on the “Start Processing” button
in this step, the process of extracting the stone from the image should
commence:
• When user click on start processing button, the application must
establish a demarcation for the stone within the background. The image
and the delineation of the stone must be presented to the user through the
graphical user interface (GUI), referred to as the “segmentation page.”
• To establish boundaries for stone, multiple elements may be
necessary. These elements should be customizable on the “segmentation
page,” allowing users to edit them if the app is unable to segment the
stone mask effectively. It is crucial to ensure that when users modify these
elements, the boundaries are updated in real time. A range type is
preferable for each element to accommodate this dynamic nature.
• A button should be placed on the “segmentation page” with the label
“Set as Default.” Upon clicking this button, the default value of each
element should be set to the current value of that element. Subsequently,
when the user runs the program, the stone boundary can be extracted
using these values.
• Two buttons must be located at the bottom of the “segmentation
page”: “Delete Image” and “Start.” When the user clicks on the “Delete
Image” button, the application should return to step 1 and allow the user to
select another image. The “Start” button does not require any action for
this step.
